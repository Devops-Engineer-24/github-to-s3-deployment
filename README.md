Project: Auto Deploy to S3 from GitHub using AWS Lambda and API Gateway
# github-to-s3-deployment

Overview:
The project will set up an AWS Lambda function that is triggered by GitHub webhooks. When a change is pushed to the GitHub repository, the Lambda function will fetch the latest code from GitHub and upload it to an AWS S3 bucket. This could be useful for hosting a static website or an application.
